# simple-alphabet-cipher

a module created after a dinner talk with my 7 year old.  We are using it to learn about programming.

Use it to scramble and descramble messages.

`import cac`

`cac.scramble(text)`

Calling scramble will scramble or descramble the text.

A message file is added for quick scrambling and descrambling short text or text in a file.

Also an interactive script to play with the kids.

Finally, play with it online @ https://play.themonkeyplayground.com:8888
